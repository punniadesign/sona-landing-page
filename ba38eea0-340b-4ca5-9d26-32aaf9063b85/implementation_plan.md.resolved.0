# Implementation Plan - Cursor Clearing Effect

The goal is to modify the background gradient so that it "clears" (becomes transparent/reveals the solid background) around the cursor as it moves.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> This change involves using CSS `mask-image`. Most modern browsers support this, but older browsers might just show the full gradient without the clearing effect. This is an acceptable progressive enhancement.

## Proposed Changes

### CSS
#### [MODIFY] [f1.css](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/css/f1.css)
- Move the base background color `var(--color-pal-cream)` from `#interactive-bg` to `body` (or ensure body has it) so that when the blobs are masked out, the solid background is visible.
- Update `#interactive-bg`:
    - Remove `background: var(--color-pal-cream)` (or set to transparent).
    - Add `mask-image` and `-webkit-mask-image` to create a radial gradient mask.
    - The mask will be a circle at the cursor position (defined by `--mouse-x` and `--mouse-y`) that is transparent at the center and opaque outside.
    - Formula: `radial-gradient(circle at calc(var(--mouse-x) * 100%) calc(var(--mouse-y) * 100%), transparent 100px, black 250px)` (adjusting sizes for the "clearing" radius).

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Open [index.html](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/index.html) in the browser.
- Move the mouse around the screen.
- Verify that the colorful blobs disappear/fade out immediately around the cursor, revealing the solid cream background.
- Verify that the clearing effect follows the cursor smoothly.
