# Walkthrough - Meet Sona Hover Carousel

I have transformed the static image in the "Meet Sona" section into an interactive carousel that cycles through images when hovered.

## Changes

### HTML
#### [index.html](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/index.html)
- Replaced the single image in `#meet-sona-carousel` with three images ([carousel-1.png](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/assets/images/carousel-1.png), [carousel-2.png](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/assets/images/carousel-2.png), [carousel-3.png](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/assets/images/carousel-3.png)).
- Added JavaScript logic to cycle the `active` class on these images when the container is hovered.
- The cycle resets to the first image when the mouse leaves.

### CSS
#### [f1.css](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/css/f1.css)
- Updated `.meet-sona-image` to `position: relative`.
- Added `.carousel-img` with `position: absolute`, `opacity: 0`, and a smooth transition.
- Added `.carousel-img.active` with `opacity: 1`.

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification
- Hovering over the image area in the "Meet Sona" section now triggers a slideshow of the product images.
- The transition is smooth (cross-dissolve).
- Moving the mouse away resets the view to the primary image.
