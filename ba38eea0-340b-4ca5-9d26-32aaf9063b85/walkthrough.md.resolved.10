# Walkthrough - Emotional Quote Section

I have added a powerful new section that highlights the emotional value of Sona for parents.

## Changes

### HTML
#### [index.html](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/index.html)
- Added the `.emotional-quote-section` immediately after the scrolly features.
- Contains the large typography summary: *"A mother’s biggest fear isn’t losing sleep..."*

### CSS
#### [f1.css](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/css/f1.css)
- **Typography**: Large, elegant font size (3.5rem) to make a statement.
- **Animation**: Implemented a "reveal" effect where the text transitions from `opacity: 0`, `blur(15px)`, and `translateY(40px)` to a clear, centered state when viewed.

### JavaScript
#### [index.html](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/index.html)
- Hooked the new section into the existing IntersectionObserver to trigger the animation at the perfect moment.

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification
- **Scroll Reveal**: Scroll down past the features. As the new text enters the screen, it should smoothly fade in and sharpen (un-blur).
- **Impact**: The large text and animation should draw full attention before moving to the Trust section.
