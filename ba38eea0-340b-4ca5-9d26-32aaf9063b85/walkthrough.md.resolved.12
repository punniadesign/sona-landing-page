# Walkthrough - Video Scrollytelling Section

I have added a new immersive section featuring full-screen feature reveals with accompanying videos.

## Changes

### HTML
#### [index.html](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/index.html)
- Added `.video-scrolly-section` with sticking container.
- Includes 3 panels:
    1. **Effortless Charging** (charging.mp4)
    2. **Gentle Glow** (glow.mp4)
    3. **Secure Clip** (clip.mp4)

### CSS
#### [f1.css](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/css/f1.css)
- **Sticky Scrolling**: The container is fixed for `300vh` worth of scrolling.
- **Transitions**: Panels fade in/out (`opacity`, `0.8s`) as you scroll.
- **Layout**: 50/50 split (Text / Video) that stacks on mobile.

### JavaScript
#### [index.html](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/index.html)
- **Scroll Logic**: Calculates scroll progress within the section (0-100%).
- **Activation**: Triggers the `.active` class on the relevant panel based on progress (0-33%, 33-66%, 66-100%).
- **Auto-Play**: Automatically plays the video when its panel becomes active and pauses/resets it when inactive.

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification
- **Sequential Reveal**: Scroll down to the new section. As you scroll, "Effortless Charging" should fade into "Gentle Glow" and then "Secure Clip".
- **Video Playback**: Confirm videos loop and play automatically when their section comes into focus.
