# Walkthrough - Playful Product Intro Redesign

I have redesigned the "Product Introduction" section to be more vibrant, playful, and interactive.

## Changes

### HTML
#### [index.html](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/index.html)
- Added specific modifier classes (`card-pink`, `card-sage`, `card-teal`) to the product cards to allow for unique styling.

### CSS
#### [f1.css](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/css/f1.css)
- **Layout**: Switched to a flex layout with `center` alignment to support staggered positioning.
- **Card Styling**:
    - Applied unique pastel gradients to each card.
    - Implemented a "messy" stacked look with rotations (-3deg, 0, 3deg) and vertical offsets.
    - Added a bouncy transition curve (`cubic-bezier`).
- **Interaction**: On hover, cards straighten up, scale up significantly, and rise above the others (`z-index`).

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification
- **Visuals**: The section should now look like a playful arrangement of cards rather than a strict grid.
- **Interactivity**: Hovering over a card should make it "pop" out of the stack with a pleasing bounce, drawing focus to the content.
