# Walkthrough - Feature Expansion & Aligned Layout

I have updated the "Product Introduction" section to include two new key features and refined the layout to be clean and aligned.

## Changes

### HTML
#### [index.html](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/index.html)
- Added **"Roll Detection"** card:
    - Checks for unsafe sleep positions.
    - Uses [co-sleeping-baby.png](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/assets/images/co-sleeping-baby.png).
- Added **"Breathing Tracking"** card:
    - Monitors breathing patterns.
    - Uses [illustration-baby.png](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/assets/images/illustration-baby.png).

### CSS
#### [f1.css](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/css/f1.css)
- **Layout**: Reverted the staggered/rotated styles to a clean, centered flex grid.
- **Card Styling**:
    - Removed `transform: rotate` and `translateY` offsets.
    - Kept the distinct pastel backgrounds (`Pink`, `Sage`, `Teal`) for visual variety.
    - Standardized hover effects to a simple lift and scale.

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification
- **Layout**: You should see 5 cards in total, arranged neatly (likely 3 on top, 2 on the bottom on desktop).
- **Consitency**: All cards are straight and aligned.
- **Content**: The new Roll Detection and Breathing Tracking info is present.
