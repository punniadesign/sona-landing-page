# Walkthrough - Scrollytelling Features

I have completely transformed the "Product Introduction" section into an immersive, scroll-driven experience. Instead of a static grid, users now discover features one by one as they scroll.

## Changes

### HTML
#### [index.html](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/index.html)
- Replaced the `.card-grid` with a `.scrolly-features-section`.
- Added a `.sticky-stage` that stays pinned during the scroll.
- Included a `.previews-row` for minimizing features and a `.feature-display` for the expanded cards.

### CSS
#### [f1.css](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/css/f1.css)
- **Sticky Layout**: Defined a `500vh` scroll track to allow plenty of time for reading each feature.
- **Glassmorphism Spec**: Updated the `.feature-card` to use a sophisticated glass effect, positioning it centrally.
- **Transitions**: Added smooth opacity and transform transitions for the "unfold" animation effect.

### JavaScript
#### [index.html](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/index.html)
- Implemented a scroll listener that maps the user's progress through the section (0% to 100%) to the 5 feature cards.
- Automatically toggles the `.active` class on the visible feature and its corresponding preview tab.

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification
- **Scroll Interaction**: As you scroll down the "Made for peaceful nights" section, the page should "stick".
- **Sequence**: The feature cards (Gentle Design, Co-sleeping Safe, etc.) should fade in and expand one after another, replacing the previous one.
- **Progress**: The small preview row at the top should highlight the current feature.
