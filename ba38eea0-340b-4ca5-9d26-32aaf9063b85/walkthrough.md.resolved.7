# Walkthrough - Sea Shell Cursor

I have added a custom sea shell cursor to enhance the immersive, beach-inspired theme of the site.

## Changes

### Assets
#### [assets/images/cursor-shell.png](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/assets/images/cursor-shell.png)
- Generated a custom pastel sea shell icon (64x64px).

### CSS
#### [f1.css](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/css/f1.css)
- Updated the `body`, `a`, `button`, and interactive elements to use the new `cursor-shell.png` as their pointer.
- Set the hotspot to the center of the shell for precise clicking.

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification
- **Visuals**: As you move your mouse across the page, the default arrow pointer should be replaced by a cute sea shell graphic.
- **Functionality**: Links and buttons should still be clickable and show the pointer variation (shell).
