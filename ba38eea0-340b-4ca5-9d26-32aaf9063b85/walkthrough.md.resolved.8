# Walkthrough - Sea Shell Cursor

I have added a custom sea shell cursor to enhance the immersive, beach-inspired theme of the site.

## Changes

### Assets
#### [assets/images/cursor-shell.svg](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/assets/images/cursor-shell.svg)
- Created a lightweight SVG icon featuring a sea shell (🐚) to ensure crisp rendering and fast loading across all browsers.

### CSS
#### [f1.css](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/css/f1.css)
- Updated the `body`, `a`, `button`, and interactive elements to use the new [cursor-shell.svg](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/assets/images/cursor-shell.svg) pointer.
- The use of SVG prevents issues with large file sizes that caused the previous PNG cursors to fail.

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification
- **Visuals**: As you move your mouse across the page, the default arrow pointer should be replaced by a clear 🐚 shell graphic.
- **Functionality**: Links and buttons should still be clickable and show the pointer variation (shell).
