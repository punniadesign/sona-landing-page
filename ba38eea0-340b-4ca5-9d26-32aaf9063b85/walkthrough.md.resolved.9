# Walkthrough - Organic Curves

I have updated the "Why Parents Trust Sona" section with soft, organic curves, replacing the rigid waves.

## Changes

### HTML
#### [index.html](file:///c:/Users/hp/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/sona-landing-page/index.html)
- Replaced standard SVG waves with custom, asymmetrical organic paths.
- **Top curve**: A gentle, flowing dip that feels nurturing.
- **Bottom curve**: A smooth, rolling rise that transitions cleanly to the next section.

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification
- **Visuals**: The green section should now feel like a natural, flowing shape rather than a hard geometric block.
- **Seamlessness**: Verify there are no white gaps between the curve and the section content.
